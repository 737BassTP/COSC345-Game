# Assignment 1

The player will explore Dunedin.
Goal - return albatross egg to peninsula
Weather - from data set. Affects rate of energy depletion
Random encounters - each region has different distributions of spawning enemy types
Enemies - sentient food. The player can eat the food to heal and gain status effects if they win, if not nothing happens
Bosses - us four, each associated with a different macro + sugar
Final boss - Dr Trotman

For our 345 project we will be building a 2d game with puzzles and rpg mechanics using the C programming language and SDL2 libraries. We intend for the game to have educational mechanics while being a fun experience.
## Data Sets
### Food Data
[Food data download link]
### Weather Data
[Weather data download link](https://www.physics.otago.ac.nz/eman/weather_station/archive.php)

We are using weather data sourced from the Energy Studies Weather Station of the University of Otago. In game weather will be determined by the weather patterns of the last twelve months. In order for players to experience meaningful changes in weather/time of day without playing for hours at a time, each 24 hour period of data is condensed down into 10 minutes of gameplay. Likewise seasons will be 8 days long each.

Variables will be used in game as follows:
 - Temperature - temperatures outside of a comfortable range


### Conservation Data
Conservation data will be used inside quizzes with the player earning score for each question answered successfully. The player may need to pass a test in order to progress to the next section.
### Geospatial Data
Our map is going to be based on the map of Dunedin.
## The Project
The datasets go together as the 2d style rpg game we are developing can make great use of weather data, food data and conservation data as gameplay mechanics.
Examples of this are weather patterns being included in our game as a scene setter and potential enviroment hazard, food data as an rpg energy mechanic and conservation data being used in quizzes and minigames.
The player will explore Dunedin.
Goal - return albatross egg to peninsula
Weather - from data set. Affects rate of energy depletion and what enemies show up
Random encounters - each region has different distributions of spawning enemy types
Enemies - sentient food. The player can eat the food to heal and gain status effects if they win, if not nothing happens
Trivia questions - unlock chests of food for pacifists, obtain items
Bosses - us four, each associated with a different macro + sugar
Final boss - Dr Trotman
Score - defeating food, answering trivia, time bonus

## Organization
We are using a Trello board to organise the tasks that need to be done and to keep track of deadlines.
Communcation is being maintained daily through a messenger group chat.
There are lists for:
 - To Do
 - Doing
 - Done
 - Concepts - this list includes ideas of different software projects we could build, as well as ideas for the project and team names and game terms.
 - Datasets - this list organises the potential datasets we could use for the project.
 - Uses for food data
 - Second dataset ideas
 - Files
 - Features
 - Core Mechanics
 - Desirable Mechanics
 
## Include either a Gantt chart or a PERT chart

## Risk Analysis
Risks include:
Team member dropping out due to unforseen circumstances.
Technical challenges such as learning SDL2 and advanced C languages while completing the project.
Creating a polished and fun experience within the 12 week time frame.
Scope creep.


We will mitigate these risks working inside a realistic scope, communicating clearly with eachother and sticking to our core vision with extras being added afterwards.
Feedback will be acquired during the testing phases with as many bugs as possible removed before final release.

### ChatGPT
 - We asked ChatGPT what data set would complement a video game using nutritional data and it suggested weather data. Weather data was used in he project but in a different way to what was suggested.
