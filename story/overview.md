# Mission
Andrew has cast a spell that has temporarily brought all the food in Duneatin' to life. He needs a special albatross egg to make the spell permanent. The player has the egg and must defeat Andrew and return the egg to its home on the peninsula.

# Side quests
Along the way, the player can help NPCs for rewards. They may have to answer trivia questions, fetch items, or defeat enemies in a particular location. Rewards may be stats effects, items, healing, or progression to previously locked area.

# Minibosses
The player must defeat each of the developers, who are minibosses spread out across the map. Each one of us represents a different macronutrient - carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Alcohol is also represented to make four components that provide calories when consumed.

# Final Boss
Andrew will be the final boss. He fights by throwing chocolate at the player, which initially heals and speeds up the player but when a certain amount of sugar is in the player's system, starts to be damaging.
