# Introduction

*The player spawns in a small room where they can ppick up an albatross egg before leaving*

*As the player leaves the spawn area, a villager introduces himself to the player*

Greetings, adventurer! Welcome to Dunedin, where the food is plenty and we are never done eating!

*A hamburger appears and attacks the villager, killing him*

*Dr Trotman appears*

Not if I have anything to say about that! This is now Duneatin'! I have brought all the food to life! Now all I need is an albatross egg to make the spell permanent, then with my army, I will take over the world!

You there! WHat are you looking at? [insert food pun name], attack!

*Combat tutorial with an easy encounter*

Gah, you demolished my Super Nefarious Attack Contingent! I'll be back!
