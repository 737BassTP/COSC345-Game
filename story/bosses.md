# Bosses
The four developers are bosses and represented in game as people who exemplify one of the four food types.

The fights will have the players intially not having enough stats to easily challenge the bosses, but will gain bonuses from defeating lieutenants that will make them capable of doing so.

# Lairs
Each boss can be found in their lair, a location specific to them. Before the boss can be fought, the player must defeat mini-bosses/lieutenants.
