COSC345 Game Notes
Remove entries when they are fixed.

- Still no death when health is depleted
- F1 game controls can be more informative
- Water Traps:
	165 from N
	122 from W
	239 from E
	142 from N
	187 from E
	55 from W
	77 from W
  Should be able to patch these by making sure waterlines match between adjacent tiles
- Food can walk on water and through walls
- Unable to move when starting a new game but issue resolved when restarting the game
- On screen information about food/enemy stats would help passive education (eg showing +10 health when defeating an enemy)
- Cutscene can display in corner controls for next line or to skip scene
- 436 of Underworld in Matthew's dungeon should have the blue gate closed when the player enters
- Level 503 should have red gate closed
- Picture on 134 cannot be picked up
- Add the remove weather effects key and how to use levers to the controls in user documentation
- Using the F key for attack is more intuitive and similar to other games.
